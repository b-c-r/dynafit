Description: This package will host functions to estimate the strength of
    density-dependent symbiotic species interactions as part of the
    DFG-funded research unit 5726, DynaSym
    (https://www.dynasym.uni-konstanz.de/). The research unit aims at
    combining laboratory experiments and ecological theory, which requires
    sophisticated statistical methods, including the combination of
    numerical simulations of population models with maximum likelihood
    estimators, or Bayesian MCMC parameter estimation. The package will
    include functions to fit, e.g., several functional response models or
    nutrient uptake models while correcting for inferring processes such
    as resource growth or consumer death that would otherwise harm precise
    parameter estimation.
